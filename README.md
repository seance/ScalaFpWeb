Scala Web study
===============

A small study of various Scala web frameworks/toolkits for implementing a RESTful API, while keeping an eye open for FP (Functional Programming) opportunities.

The `frontend` directory contains a Bacon.js / Backbone.js based frontend for the Todos application, copied from [pyykkis](https://github.com/pyykkis)'s TodoMVC example. The other directories contain backend implementations using the various frameworks.

You can serve the frontend directory from any HTTP server on port 7000, or use curl to test the backends. Each backend exercises the basic todos API, with CORS and browser extensions for exploring composability.

Scalatra
--------

_"Scalatra is a simple, accessible and free web micro-framework. It combines the power of the JVM with the beauty and brevity of Scala, helping you quickly build high-performance web sites and APIs."_

### Factoids
* Strongly influenced by Sinatra framework for Ruby
* Servlet/Filter based - proven stability as part of core philosophy
* HTTP oriented, in design and implementation
* Mutable state based routing definition DSL
* Available for Scala 2.10
* Actively developed by team

### Opinions
Simple, effective and proven, yet rather only embraces Scala's OO nature without much FP utility. This is of course in line with Sinatra's Ruby language, but makes functional composition more difficult.

Finagle
-------

_"Finagle is an extensible network stack for the JVM, used to construct highly concurrent servers. Finagle implements uniform client and server APIs for several protocols, and is designed for high performance and concurrency. Most of Finagleâ€™s code is protocol agnostic, simplifying the implementation of new protocols."_

### Factoids
* Protocol agnostic; not only HTTP
* For now only for Scala 2.9
* Futures based on own abstraction; influenced the Scala 2.10 standard
* Developed by Twitter

### Opinions
Finagle's flexibility also means some extra complexity is accrued for implementing a simple HTTP/REST API. Some of Netty's Java idiosyncrasies bleed through to the otherwise nice clean Scala DSL.

Lift
----

_"Lift is the most powerful, most secure web framework available today. There are Seven Things that distinguish Lift from other web frameworks."_

### Factoids
* One of the most established Scala web frameworks
* Servlet based
* For now only for Scala 2.9
* Emphasis on server templated web applications, with many supporting modules
* Own implementations for Actors, Futures, etc
* Developed by David Pollak & team

### Opinions
Conceived in the early days of Scala, Lift suffers somewhat from duplicating functionality refined in smaller, more focused libraries. Lift has however pioneered the way for later frameworks, not least with its popular JSON library. Lift's process for creating new projects and some of its syntactic and organizational choices may raise some eyebrows nowadays.

Play Framework 2.1
------------------

_"The High Velocity Web Framework For Java and Scala"_

### Factoids
* More a full platform than library - server, classloader, compiler
* Now part of the Typesafe Stack from Typesafe - the company with Scala's creator Martin Odersky
* Integrates with Akka, also part of the Typesafe Stack
* Incorporates advanced features, such as Web Sockets and Iteratee I/O
* Quick development turnaround with on-the-fly compile and redeploy
* Available for Scala 2.10
* Developed by Guillaume Bort & Typesafe

### Opinions
Play Framework elbowed its way into the JVM web scene quite spectacularly, winning solid recognition in the Scala world by being adopted as a part of the Typesafe umbrella in its version 2.x incarnation. Very practically oriented, Play's external routing DSL has some limitations compared with some of the latest crop of pure Scala frameworks, especially in functional composition.
