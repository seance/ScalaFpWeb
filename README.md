Scala Web study
===============

A small study of various Scala web frameworks/toolkits for implementing a RESTful API, while keeping an eye open for FP (Functional Programming) opportunities.

The `frontend` directory contains a Bacon.js / Backbone.js based frontend for the Todos application, copied from [pyykkis](https://github.com/pyykkis)'s TodoMVC example. The other directories contain backend implementations using the various frameworks.

You can serve the frontend directory from any HTTP server on port 7000, or use curl to test the backends. Each backend exercises the basic todos API, with CORS and browser extensions for exploring composability.
